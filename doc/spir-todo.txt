pocl now loads SPIR binaries via the clCreateProgramWithBinary interface.
However, support for SPIR is not complete. At least the following needs to
be done:

bitcode linkage warning
-----------------------

Data layouts and the target triplets differ (SPIR32/SPIR64 and the target 
specific) one. Not sure if this causes more harm than the warning, though, 
because the SPIR alignment settings of data types are wider than those of 
the target's. Wider alignment should be compatible with shorter one, 
thus this should be OK.

mangling of address spaces
--------------------------

pocl now uses the -ffake-addr-space-map ids internally and for the kernel
builtin library. The IDs do not match the ones in SPIR, therefore the SPIR
refers to overloaded versions which might not be found in the kernel library.
SPIR specs requires adding the AS id to the mangling.

Alternative solutions:

1) Somehow force the SPIR address space ids to be used when building the
builtin library, which should result in the same mangling to be used
regardless of when compiling from a source or from SPIR binary. There
doesn't seem to be a switch for this (yet). Perhaps the cleanest way
would be to submit a new clang switch that forces the SPIR IDs to be used
after which pocl could use those internally instead of the fake ones.

How badly would it break if the kernel library was built always with
a SPIR target? We are not optimizing them at this phase anyways.
At least we could provide spir32 and spir64 versions of the libraries
which are linked only in case loaded from the binary.

2) A new module pass that translates SPIR mangled functions to the ones 
using the fake AS IDs, after which they can be found again.

3) Produce the SPIR mangling by hand using C prototypes to kernel
library. This is a bit ugly, but might work.

SPIR address space ids vs. pocl internal ones
---------------------------------------------

Currently the SPIR AS IDs and the -ffake-addr-spacemap ids do not match,
therefore pocl kernel compiler detects the SPIR address spaces wrongly.
Especially the special treatment of local AS is thus broken.

A solution would be to execute the TargetAddressSpaces pass to convert from 
the SPIR ones to the target ones before proceeding with the other kernel
compiler passes (that refer to the "logical ids"). The above 1) solution
would fix this too.

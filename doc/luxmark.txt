All of the Luxmark v2.0 scenes work with pocl. 

Tested with an LLVM 3.3 (trunk at 2013-03-14).

There's a small issue in the Luxmark itself:

To circumvent this, use the 'basic' device driver which
reports only CL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU. It doesn't multithread so
the best performance is not reached, but should be OK for
verification.
